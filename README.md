# OpenFundDAO

**OpenFundDAO** is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) dedicated to funding and supporting open-source projects. Our mission is to democratize access to financial resources for developers and contributors working on open-source technological solutions.

## Mission

The mission of **OpenFundDAO** is to accelerate the development of open-source projects, ensuring contributors are fairly and transparently rewarded. Through decentralized governance and collective decisions, we aim to empower developers and the community to take control of their innovations.

## How It Works

1. **Project Proposals**: Any member of the community can submit a proposal to fund an open-source project. These proposals include:
   - Project description
   - Development plan
   - Milestones
   - Developer rewards

2. **Community Voting**: **OpenFundDAO** members use governance tokens to vote on proposals they want to fund. Voting is transparent and conducted on decentralized platforms like **Snapshot**.

3. **Decentralized Funding**: Once a proposal is approved by the community, funds are automatically allocated to the project via smart contracts, with release based on project progress.

4. **Contributor Rewards**: Developers and contributors who work on projects funded by the DAO receive governance tokens as a reward for their work.

## Value Delivery

- **Democratic Funding**: The community decides in a decentralized way which open-source projects will be funded.
- **Fair Rewards**: Developers and contributors are rewarded with tokens for their contributions.
- **Decentralized Governance**: DAO members have an active voice and participate in decisions through transparent voting.
- **Growth of the Open-Source Community**: We encourage the creation and maintenance of projects that benefit the open-source ecosystem.

## Governance

**OpenFundDAO** operates with a decentralized governance system, where members use **governance tokens** to vote on:

- New project proposals
- Changes in resource allocation
- Modifications in the structure and rules of the DAO

### Governance Token

Governance tokens are distributed to members who:
- Contribute to DAO-approved projects
- Participate in activities that benefit the DAO, such as marketing, development, and support
- Invest directly in the DAO ecosystem

## How to Participate

1. **Submit a Project**: If you're an open-source developer seeking funding for your project, you can submit a proposal following our community template.
   
2. **Participate in Voting**: Acquire governance tokens and participate in the votes that shape the DAO's future.

3. **Contribute**: Help with projects funded by the DAO and receive tokens as a reward for your work.

## Roadmap

- [x] Launch of the governance token
- [ ] First round of funding for open-source projects
- [ ] Expansion to new markets and partnerships with companies that use open-source

## Tools Used

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum or Polygon for transparent governance and transactions.
- **Snapshot**: Tool for conducting off-chain votes without gas fees.
- **Smart Contracts**: Used to release funds automatically based on project milestones.
- **Discord**: Community for support and discussions around proposals and projects.
- **Twitter**: Regular updates on new proposals and open votes.
